What is Power BI, and what are its three main components?

Power BI is a business intelligence (BI) and data visualization tool developed by Microsoft.
It helps transform raw data into interactive and shareable dashboards and reports.

Three main components:

Power BI Desktop – A Windows application used for creating reports and data models.

Power BI Service – An online SaaS (cloud) platform for sharing and collaborating on reports.

Power BI Mobile – Mobile apps (iOS, Android, Windows) for viewing dashboards on the go.

2. Name two business use cases for Power BI dashboards.

Sales performance tracking – Monitor total revenue, top-selling products, and monthly growth.

Financial reporting – Visualize budget vs. actual spending and profitability by department.

3. How do you download and install Power BI Desktop?

Visit https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop
.

Click “Download free” and choose Microsoft Store or direct installer (PBIDesktopSetup.exe).

Follow installation prompts and launch Power BI Desktop.

(Optional) Sign in with your Microsoft account to publish reports online.

4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?
Feature	Power BI Desktop	Power BI Service
Purpose	Create reports & data models	Share, collaborate, and view reports
Installation	Installed locally	Cloud-based
Usage	Data transformation, modeling	Online publishing, sharing, scheduled refresh
File extension	.pbix	Hosted content in the cloud
5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?

.pbix — Power BI Desktop report files.

6. Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.

Power Query is the data transformation and cleaning engine within Power BI.
It allows users to:

Import data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL, web, etc.).

Clean, merge, and shape data before loading it into the model.

Automate data preparation using a simple interface (no coding needed).

7. Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?

Interactive dashboards vs. static Excel charts.

Automated data refresh from multiple sources.

Stronger data modeling (relationships, DAX calculations).

Collaboration & security through cloud-based sharing.

Scalability for large datasets.

8. Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.

Reports cannot be shared with others in the cloud (only viewed locally).
Sharing requires a Power BI Pro or Premium license.

9. What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?

A published report is a report created in Power BI Desktop and uploaded (“published”) to the Power BI Service, allowing others to:

View it online or on mobile,

Interact with visuals,

Receive automatic updates when data changes.

10. How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?

View and interact with dashboards anywhere.

Receive real-time alerts and notifications.

Support for touchscreen navigation and offline access.

11. Compare Power BI with Tableau — pros and cons.
Criteria	Power BI	Tableau
Ease of Use	Easier for beginners, especially Excel users	Steeper learning curve
Integration	Deeply integrated with Microsoft tools (Excel, Azure)	Works well across many data platforms
Cost	More affordable	More expensive
Customization	Good visualization options	More advanced visual customization
Performance	Excellent for medium datasets	Better for very large datasets
12. Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.

Power BI integrates with Microsoft Azure by:

Connecting to Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Lake for live data.

Using Azure Machine Learning models to add predictive insights.

Managing identity and security through Azure Active Directory (AAD).

13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?

A gateway connects on-premises data sources (like SQL Server or Excel on local computers) to Power BI Service securely.
Used when:

Data is stored on local servers.

Reports in the cloud need real-time or scheduled refreshes from local sources.

14. How would you convince a company to adopt Power BI? (ROI argument)

Low cost, high impact: Affordable compared to competitors.

Fast insights: Real-time dashboards reduce manual reporting time.

Better decisions: Visual analytics improve understanding and accuracy.

Integration: Works seamlessly with Excel, Teams, and Azure.
➡️ Result: More informed decisions and time savings = higher ROI.

15. What security features does Power BI offer for sensitive data?

Row-Level Security (RLS) – restricts data access per user role.

Data encryption – at rest and in transit.

Azure Active Directory (AAD) – identity and access control.

Auditing and compliance – logs user activities and meets enterprise standards (GDPR, ISO).rBI
